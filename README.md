# kids_create_NFTs

Classroom project to where my Grade 8 elementary kids will be using Ravencoin to create an asset (NFT) either each crate their own or split asset owed by all 
Ravencoin donations greatly appreciated. Building my "Rubic".  Coding for kids is a great prerequisite,  in my classroom we can further introduce kids to blockchain technology assets NFTs etc. Please feel free to suggest any user friendly "how to" and or articles references that can be contributed to building the my planned "Unit"
